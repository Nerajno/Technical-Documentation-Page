					Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed reflective programming language.
					Smalltalk was created as the language underpinning the "new world" of computing exemplified
					by "human–computer symbiosis". It was designed and created in part for educational use,
					specifically for constructionist learning, at the Learning Research Group (LRG) of Xerox PARC
					by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, Diana Merry, Scott Wallace, and others during the 1970s.
					The language was first generally released as Smalltalk-80. Smalltalk-like languages are in active development
					and have gathered loyal communities of users around them. ANSI Smalltalk was ratified in 1998 and represents the
					standard version of Smalltalk.

				<p>There are a large number of Smalltalk variants.[6] The unqualified word Smalltalk is often used to indicate the
					Smalltalk-80 language, the first version to be made publicly available and created in 1980. The first
					environment to run the Smalltalk were Xerox Alto computers.

					Smalltalk was the product of research led by Alan Kay at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC); Alan Kay
					designed most of the early Smalltalk versions, Adele Goldberg wrote most of the documentation, and Dan Ingalls
					implemented most of the early versions. The first version, termed Smalltalk-71, was created by Kay in a few
					mornings on a bet that a programming language based on the idea of message passing inspired by Simula could be
					implemented in "a page of code". A later variant used for research work is now termed Smalltalk-72 and
					influenced the development of the Actor model. Its syntax and execution model were very different from modern
					Smalltalk variants.

					After significant revisions which froze some aspects of execution semantics to gain performance (by adopting a
					Simula-like class inheritance model of execution), Smalltalk-76 was created. This system had a development
					environment featuring most of the now familiar tools, including a class library code browser/editor.
					Smalltalk-80 added metaclasses, to help maintain the "everything is an object" (except private instance
					variables) paradigm by associating properties and behavior with individual classes, and even primitives such as
					integer and boolean values (for example, to support different ways to create instances).

					Smalltalk-80 was the first language variant made available outside of PARC, first as Smalltalk-80 Version 1,
					given to a small number of firms (Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer, Tektronix, and Digital Equipment Corporation
					(DEC)) and universities (UC Berkeley) for peer review and implementing on their platforms. Later (in 1983) a
					general availability implementation, named Smalltalk-80 Version 2, was released as an image
					(platform-independent file with object definitions) and a virtual machine specification. ANSI Smalltalk has been
					the standard language reference since 1998.</p>

			<header>Object Oriented Programming</header>
			<article>
				<p>As in other object-oriented languages, the central concept in Smalltalk-80 (but not in Smalltalk-72) is that of
					an object. An object is always an instance of a class. Classes are "blueprints" that describe the properties and
					behavior of their instances. For example, a GUI's window class might declare that windows have properties such
					as the label, the position and whether the window is visible or not. The class might also declare that instances
					support operations such as opening, closing, moving and hiding. Each particular window object would have its own
					values of those properties, and each of them would be able to perform operations defined by its class.

					A Smalltalk object can do exactly three things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Hold state (references to other objects).</li>
						<li>Receive a message from itself or another object.</li>
						<li>In the course of processing a message, send messages to itself or another object.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>The state an object holds is always private to that object. Other objects can query or change that state only by
					sending requests (messages) to the object to do so. Any message can be sent to any object: when a message is
					received, the receiver determines whether that message is appropriate. Alan Kay has commented that despite the
					attention given to objects, messaging is the most important concept in Smalltalk: "The big idea is
					'messaging'—that is what the kernel of Smalltalk/Squeak is all about (and it's something that was never quite
					completed in our Xerox PARC phase)."

					Unlike most other languages, Smalltalk objects can be modified while the system is running. Live coding and
					applying fixes ‘on-the-fly’ is a dominant programming methodology for Smalltalk and is one of the main reasons
					for its incredible efficiency.

					Smalltalk is a "pure" object-oriented programming language, meaning that, unlike C++ and Java, there is no
					difference between values which are objects and values which are primitive types. In Smalltalk, primitive values
					such as integers, booleans and characters are also objects, in the sense that they are instances of
					corresponding classes, and operations on them are invoked by sending messages. A programmer can change or extend
					(through subclassing) the classes that implement primitive values, so that new behavior can be defined for their
					instances—for example, to implement new control structures—or even so that their existing behavior will be
					changed. This fact is summarized in the commonly heard phrase "In Smalltalk everything is an object", which may
					be more accurately expressed as "all values are objects", as variables are not.

					Since all values are objects, classes are also objects. Each class is an instance of the metaclass of that
					class. Metaclasses in turn are also objects, and are all instances of a class called Metaclass. Code
					blocks—Smalltalk's way of expressing anonymous functions—are also objects</p>

		<section class="" id="Syntax"><header>Syntax</header>
			<article>
				<p>Smalltalk-80 syntax is rather minimalist, based on only a handful of declarations and reserved words. In fact,
					only six "keywords" are reserved in Smalltalk: true, false, nil, self, super, and thisContext. These are
					properly termed pseudo-variables, identifiers that follow the rules for variable identifiers but denote
					bindings
					that a programmer cannot change. The true, false, and nil pseudo-variables are singleton instances. self and
					super refer to the receiver of a message within a method activated in response to that message, but sends to
					super are looked up in the superclass of the method's defining class rather than the class of the receiver,
					which allows methods in subclasses to invoke methods of the same name in superclasses. thisContext refers to
					the
					current activation record. The only built-in language constructs are message sends, assignment, method return
					and literal syntax for some objects. From its origins as a language for children of all ages, standard
					Smalltalk
					syntax uses punctuation in a manner more like English than mainstream coding languages. The remainder of the
					language, including control structures for conditional evaluation and iteration, is implemented on top of the
					built-in constructs by the standard Smalltalk class library. (For performance reasons, implementations may
					recognize and treat as special some of those messages; however, this is only an optimization and is not
					hardwired into the language syntax.)

					The adage that "Smalltalk syntax fits on a postcard" refers to a code snippet by Ralph Johnson, demonstrating
					all the basic standard syntactic elements of methods:</p>

				<code>
					exampleWithNumber: x
					| y |
					true & false not & (nil isNil) ifFalse: [self halt].
					y := self size + super size.
					#($a #a "a" 1 1.0)
					do: [ :each |
					Transcript show: (each class name);
					show: ' '].
					^x < y </code> <strong>Literals</strong>
						<p>The following examples illustrate the most common objects which can be written as literal values in
							Smalltalk-80
							methods. </p>

						<strong>Numbers.</strong>

						<p> following list illustrates some of the possibilities. </p>>

						<code>
							<ul>
								<li>42</li>
								<li>-42</li>
								<li>123.45</li>
								<li>1.2345e2</li>
								<li>2r10010010</li>
								<li>16rA000</li>
							</ul>
						</code>

						<p>
							The last two entries are a binary and a hexadecimal number, respectively. The number before the 'r'
							is the radix or base. The base does not have to be a power of two; for example 36rSMALLTALK is a
							valid number equal to 80738163270632 decimal.</p>

						<p>Characters are written by preceding them with a dollar sign:</p>
					
					<code>$A</code>
					
					<p>Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes:</p>
					
					<code>'Hello, world!'</code>


					<p>To include a quote in a string, escape it using a second quote:</p>
					
						<code>'I said, ''Hello, world!'' to them.'</code>

					<p>Double quotes do not need escaping, since single quotes delimit a string:</p>
					
					<code>'I said, "Hello, world!" to them.'</code>
					<p>Two equal strings (strings are equal if they contain all the same characters) can be different objects residing in different places in memory. In addition to strings, Smalltalk has a class of character sequence objects called Symbol. Symbols are guaranteed to be unique—there can be no two equal symbols which are different objects. Because of that, symbols are very cheap to compare and are often used for language artifacts such as message selectors (see below).
					
					Symbols are written as # followed by a string literal. For example:
					
					#'foo'
					If the sequence does not include whitespace or punctuation characters, this can also be written as:
					
					#foo
					Arrays:
					
					#(1 2 3 4)
					defines an array of four integers.
					
					Many implementations support the following literal syntax for ByteArrays:
					
					#[1 2 3 4]
					defines a ByteArray of four integers.
					
					And last but not least, blocks (anonymous function literals)
					
					[... Some smalltalk code...]
					Blocks are explained in detail further in the text.
					
					Many Smalltalk dialects implement additional syntaxes for other objects, but the ones above are the essentials supported by all.
					
					Variable declarations
					The two kinds of variables commonly used in Smalltalk are instance variables and temporary variables. Other variables and related terminology depend on the particular implementation. For example, VisualWorks has class shared variables and namespace shared variables, while Squeak and many other implementations have class variables, pool variables and global variables.
					
					Temporary variable declarations in Smalltalk are variables declared inside a method (see below). They are declared at the top of the method as names separated by spaces and enclosed by vertical bars. For example:
					
					| index |
					declares a temporary variable named index which contains initially the value nil.
					
					Multiple variables may be declared within one set of bars:
					
					| index vowels |
					declares two variables: index and vowels. All variables are initialized. Variables are initialized to nil except the indexed variables of Strings, which are initialized to the null character or ByteArrays which are initialized to 0.
					
					Assignment
					A variable is assigned a value via the ':=' syntax. So:
					
					vowels := 'aeiou'
					Assigns the string 'aeiou' to the formerly declared vowels variable. The string is an object (a sequence of characters between single quotes is the syntax for literal strings), created by the compiler at compile time.
					
					In the original Parc Place image, the glyph of the underscore character ⟨_⟩ appeared as a left-facing arrow ⟨←⟩ (like in the 1963 version of the ASCII code). Smalltalk originally accepted this left-arrow as the only assignment operator. Some modern code still contains what appear to be underscores acting as assignments, hearkening back to this original usage. Most modern Smalltalk implementations accept either the underscore or the colon-equals syntax.
					
					Messages
					The message is the most fundamental language construct in Smalltalk. Even control structures are implemented as message sends. Smalltalk adopts by default a synchronous, single dynamic message dispatch strategy (as contrasted to the asynchronous, multiple dispatch strategy adopted by some other object-oriented languages).
					
					The following example sends the message 'factorial' to number 42:
					
					42 factorial
					In this situation 42 is called the message receiver, while 'factorial' is the message selector. The receiver responds to the message by returning a value (presumably in this case the factorial of 42). Among other things, the result of the message can be assigned to a variable:
					
					aRatherBigNumber := 42 factorial
					"factorial" above is what is called a unary message because only one object, the receiver, is involved. Messages can carry additional objects as arguments, as follows:
					
					2 raisedTo: 4
					In this expression two objects are involved: 2 as the receiver and 4 as the message argument. The message result, or in Smalltalk parlance, the answer is supposed to be 16. Such messages are called keyword messages. A message can have more arguments, using the following syntax:
					
					'hello world' indexOf: $o startingAt: 6
					which answers the index of character 'o' in the receiver string, starting the search from index 6. The selector of this message is "indexOf:startingAt:", consisting of two pieces, or keywords.
					
					Such interleaving of keywords and arguments is meant to improve readability of code, since arguments are explained by their preceding keywords. For example, an expression to create a rectangle using a C++ or Java-like syntax might be written as:
					
					new Rectangle(100, 200);
					It's unclear which argument is which. By contrast, in Smalltalk, this code would be written as:
					
					Rectangle width: 100 height: 200
					The receiver in this case is "Rectangle", a class, and the answer will be a new instance of the class with the specified width and height.
					
					Finally, most of the special (non-alphabetic) characters can be used as what are called binary messages. These allow mathematical and logical operators to be written in their traditional form:
					
					3 + 4
					which sends the message "+" to the receiver 3 with 4 passed as the argument (the answer of which will be 7). Similarly,
					
					3 > 4
					is the message ">" sent to 3 with argument 4 (the answer of which will be false).
					
					Notice, that the Smalltalk-80 language itself does not imply the meaning of those operators. The outcome of the above is only defined by how the receiver of the message (in this case a Number instance) responds to messages "+" and ">".
					
					A side effect of this mechanism is operator overloading. A message ">" can also be understood by other objects, allowing the use of expressions of the form "a > b" to compare them.
					
					Expressions
					An expression can include multiple message sends. In this case expressions are parsed according to a simple order of precedence. Unary messages have the highest precedence, followed by binary messages, followed by keyword messages. For example:
					
					3 factorial + 4 factorial between: 10 and: 100
					is evaluated as follows:
					
					3 receives the message "factorial" and answers 6
					4 receives the message "factorial" and answers 24
					6 receives the message "+" with 24 as the argument and answers 30
					30 receives the message "between:and:" with 10 and 100 as arguments and answers true
					The answer of the last message sent is the result of the entire expression.
					
					Parentheses can alter the order of evaluation when needed. For example,
					
					(3 factorial + 4) factorial between: 10 and: 100
					will change the meaning so that the expression first computes "3 factorial + 4" yielding 10. That 10 then receives the second "factorial" message, yielding 3628800. 3628800 then receives "between:and:", answering false.
					
					Note that because the meaning of binary messages is not hardwired into Smalltalk-80 syntax, all of them are considered to have equal precedence and are evaluated simply from left to right. Because of this, the meaning of Smalltalk expressions using binary messages can be different from their "traditional" interpretation:
					
					3 + 4 * 5
					is evaluated as "(3 + 4) * 5", producing 35. To obtain the expected answer of 23, parentheses must be used to explicitly define the order of operations:
					
					3 + (4 * 5)
					Unary messages can be chained by writing them one after another:
					
					3 factorial factorial log
					which sends "factorial" to 3, then "factorial" to the result (6), then "log" to the result (720), producing the result 2.85733.
					
					A series of expressions can be written as in the following (hypothetical) example, each separated by a period. This example first creates a new instance of class Window, stores it in a variable, and then sends two messages to it.
					
					 | window |
					  window := Window new.
					  window label: 'Hello'.
					  window open
					If a series of messages are sent to the same receiver as in the example above, they can also be written as a cascade with individual messages separated by semicolons:
					
					  Window new
						label: 'Hello';
						open
					This rewrite of the earlier example as a single expression avoids the need to store the new window in a temporary variable. According to the usual precedence rules, the unary message "new" is sent first, and then "label:" and "open" are sent to the answer of "new".
					
					Code blocks
					A block of code (an anonymous function) can be expressed as a literal value (which is an object, since all values are objects). This is achieved with square brackets:
					
					[ :params | <message-expressions> ]
					Where :params is the list of parameters the code can take. This means that the Smalltalk code:
					
					[:x | x + 1]
					can be understood as:
					
					{\displaystyle f}f : {\displaystyle f(x)=x+1}f(x)=x+1
					or expressed in lambda terms as:
					
					{\displaystyle \lambda x}\lambda x : {\displaystyle x+1}x+1
					and
					
					[:x | x + 1] value: 3
					can be evaluated as
					
					{\displaystyle f(3)=3+1}f(3)=3+1
					Or in lambda terms as:
					
					{\displaystyle (\lambda x:x+1)3_{\beta }\rightarrow 4}(\lambda x:x+1)3_{\beta }\rightarrow 4
					The resulting block object can form a closure: it can access the variables of its enclosing lexical scopes at any time. Blocks are first-class objects.
					
					Blocks can be executed by sending them the value message (compound variations exist in order to provide parameters to the block e.g. 'value:value:' and 'valueWithArguments:').
					
					The literal representation of blocks was an innovation which on the one hand allowed certain code to be significantly more readable; it allowed algorithms involving iteration to be coded in a clear and concise way. Code that would typically be written with loops in some languages can be written concisely in Smalltalk using blocks, sometimes in a single line. But more importantly blocks allow control structure to be expressed using messages and polymorphism, since blocks defer computation and polymorphism can be used to select alternatives. So if-then-else in Smalltalk is written and implemented as
					
					expr ifTrue: [statements to evaluate if expr] ifFalse: [statements to evaluate if not expr]
					
					
					True methods for evaluation
					
					ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
					
						 ^trueAlternativeBlock value
					
					False methods for evaluation
					
					ifTrue: trueAlternativeBlock ifFalse: falseAlternativeBlock
					
						^falseAlternativeBlock value
					positiveAmounts := allAmounts select: [:anAmount | anAmount isPositive]
					Note that this is related to functional programming, wherein patterns of computation (here selection) are abstracted into higher-order functions. For example, the message select: on a Collection is equivalent to the higher-order function filter on an appropriate functor.[28]</p>
